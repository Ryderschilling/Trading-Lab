## Step 1: Go to Clerk Website
Open your web browser and go to: **https://clerk.com**

---

## Step 2: Sign In or Sign Up

**If you already have an account:**
- Click "Sign In" (top right)
- Sign in with Google, GitHub, or email

**If you DON'T have an account yet:**
- Click "Start for Free" or "Sign Up"
- You can sign up with:

  - Or email address

---

## Step 3: Create a New Application

After signing in, you'll see your dashboard:

1. Click the **"Create Application"** button (big button in the middle)
   - OR if you see "New Application" or "+ New", click that

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Application name:** `Trading Lab` (or any name you want)
   - **Authentication providers:** Leave default (Email is fine)
   - Click **"Create Application"** or **"Continue"**

3. Wait 10-20 seconds for it to create

## Step 4: Find Your API Keys

After your application is created, you'll see a dashboard. Look for:

**Option A - Quick Copy (Easiest):**
- Right on the main page, you'll see two boxes:
  - One says **"Publishable Key"** with a long key starting with `pk_test_...`
  - One says **"Secret Key"** with a long key starting with `sk_test_...`
- Click the **copy icon** (📋) next to each one to copy them

**Option B - If you don't see them:**
1. Look on the left sidebar for **"API Keys"** or **"Configure"**
2. Click on it
3. You'll see:
   - **Publishable Key** = `pk_test_...` (click copy icon)
   - **Secret Key** = `sk_test_...` (click copy icon, might need to click "Reveal" first)

---

## Step 5: Copy Both Keys

**You need BOTH keys:**

1. **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - Copy this entire key
   - Example: `pk_test_abc123xyz...`

2. **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
   - Click "Reveal" if you see it (for security)
   - Copy this entire key
   - Example: `sk_test_def456uvw...`

---

## Step 6: Save Them Somewhere Safe

Paste both keys in a text file or Notes app so you have them ready for Vercel.

---

## That's It! ✅

You now have your Clerk keys. Next step is to add them to Vercel!
